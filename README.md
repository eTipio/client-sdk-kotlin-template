# Kotlin Client SDK Template for HTTP APIs

This project template demonstrates writing the client codes with Kotlin, and also tries to keep compatible from Java projects. 

To keep your codes compatible with calling from Java and Kotlin, check the Kotlin docs.
* [Calling Kotlin from Java](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/java-to-kotlin-interop.html)
* [Mixing Java and Kotlin in one project](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/mixing-java-kotlin-intellij.html)
* [Using Java records in Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/jvm-records.html)

Check the existing [Client SDK for Java Template](https://github.com/eTipio/client-sdk-template) for more details of build a client SDK for HTTP APIs.
