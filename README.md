This project template demonstrates writing the client codes with Kotlin, and also tries to keep compatible from Java projects. 

To be compatible with Java and Kotlin, check the Kotlin docs.
* [Calling Java from Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/java-to-kotlin-interop.html)
* [Mixing Java and Kotlin in one project](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/mixing-java-kotlin-intellij.html)
* [Using Java records in Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/jvm-records.html)
